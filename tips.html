            <h3>📝 Outstanding Exam Day Strategies</h3>
            
            <h4>🌅 1. Start With a “Brain Warm-Up”</h4>
            <p>Before leaving home, solve 2–3 easy questions from past papers (nothing new, nothing difficult).</p>
            <p class="highlight">👉 This wakes up your brain so the first question in the exam hall doesn’t feel like a shock.</p>
            
            <h4>🍯 2. Eat “Steady Energy” Foods, Not Heavy Ones</h4>
            <p>Eat light but energy-sustaining foods: banana, bread with honey, nuts. Avoid greasy or spicy foods — they make you sluggish or sleepy during the exam.</p>
            <p class="highlight">👉 Think of food as “fuel for a marathon,” not a feast.</p>

            <h4>🧘 3. Build a 2-Minute Calm Ritual</h4>
            <p>When you sit down in the exam hall: Close your eyes. Take three deep breaths in and out. Say to yourself silently: “I’m calm. I’m ready. I know this.”</p>
            <p class="highlight">👉 This centers your mind and blocks out exam-hall anxiety.</p>

            <h4>🔎 4. The “5-Minute Scan” Trick</h4>
            <p>When you get the paper: Spend the first 5 minutes scanning all sections quickly. Mark the questions you’re 100% confident about.</p>
            <p class="highlight">👉 This gives you a mental map of where the easy marks are, and prevents panic if you see a hard question early.</p>

            <h4>🏃 5. Attack Easy Questions First</h4>
            <p>Start with the ones you already know. This builds momentum. Your brain gets confidence, and you secure marks quickly.</p>
            <p class="highlight">👉 Only later return to the tough ones.</p>

            <h4>⏱ 6. Time-Chunking Strategy</h4>
            <p>Divide the exam time into mini-deadlines: Example: 1-hour exam = 4 chunks of 15 mins. Check progress at each chunk.</p>
            <p class="highlight">👉 This prevents you from spending 20 minutes stuck on one killer question.</p>

            <h4>❌ 7. Don’t Over-Correct</h4>
            <p>In MCQs, your first instinct is usually right. Only change your answer if you see clear evidence you were wrong. Overthinking = lost marks.</p>

            <h4>🧃 8. Micro-Recharge During the Exam</h4>
            <p>If your mind goes blank → stop writing for 15 seconds, sip water, stretch your fingers, and reset.</p>
            <p class="highlight">👉 Short pauses prevent burnout in long exams.</p>

            <h4>🧩 9. Use the “Anchor Question” Trick</h4>
            <p>If you’re stuck and panicking, quickly answer one easy question you skipped.</p>
            <p class="highlight">👉 This “anchors” your mind back to calmness and flow, instead of freezing.</p>

            <h4>📑 10. Always Leave 5–10 Minutes for Review</h4>
            <p>Re-check calculations, especially in Math, Physics, Chemistry. In Biology/English, ensure spelling of keywords is correct (they deduct for this).</p>
            <p class="highlight">👉 Many students lose marks not from lack of knowledge but from small careless mistakes.</p>

            <h4>💡 Bonus: Carry a “Confidence Anchor”</h4>
            <p>Before the exam, write one motivational line on a small paper (e.g., “I have prepared, I will succeed”). Glance at it just before entering.</p>

            <h3>🚫 What NOT to Do on EUEE Exam Days</h3>

            <h4>❌ 1. Don’t Cram in the Morning</h4>
            <p>Reading new material right before the exam only confuses your brain. It creates stress and makes you forget what you already know.</p>
            <p class="highlight">👉 Morning should be for calm review (like your one-page summary), not heavy study.</p>

            <h4>❌ 2. Don’t Copy Your Friend’s Routine</h4>
            <p>Some students like to chat or revise loudly before entering. If that distracts you, step aside and stay in your own calm zone.</p>
            <p class="highlight">👉 Your success = your own rhythm, not your friend’s.</p>

            <h4>❌ 3. Don’t Panic at Strange Questions</h4>
            <p>EUEE sometimes includes very hard or unusual questions. These are often meant to challenge only the top 1–2% — not everyone.</p>
            <p class="highlight">👉 If it feels impossible, skip it and focus on the rest. Don’t let 1 hard question steal marks from 20 easy ones.</p>

            <h4>❌ 4. Don’t Spend Too Long on Calculations</h4>
            <p>In Physics, Math, Chemistry, many students get stuck on one tough calculation.</p>
            <p class="highlight">👉 If it takes more than 3 minutes, mark it, move on, and return later.</p>

            <h4>❌ 5. Don’t Change Answers Out of Fear</h4>
            <p>First instinct = usually correct. Many students lose marks by changing right answers into wrong ones during review.</p>
            <p class="highlight">👉 Only change if you clearly see a mistake.</p>

            <h4>❌ 6. Don’t Forget Instructions</h4>
            <p>Some students rush and forget to shade correctly on the answer sheet. Or they answer in the wrong section.</p>
            <p class="highlight">👉 Always read the first page instructions carefully. These are free marks most students lose.</p>

            <h4>❌ 7. Don’t Waste Breaks</h4>
            <p>Between exams, some students panic, gossip, or argue over answers.</p>
            <p class="highlight">👉 Better: drink water, eat a snack, relax, and reset for the next subject.</p>

            <h4>❌ 8. Don’t Compare After Each Exam</h4>
            <p>Asking friends “What did you write?” only increases anxiety.</p>
            <p class="highlight">👉 Once you hand in your paper, forget it and focus on the next one.</p>

            <h4>❌ 9. Don’t Forget Your Tools</h4>
            <p>Common disasters: no sharp pencil, no eraser, calculator battery dead.</p>
            <p class="highlight">👉 Pack everything the night before: pens, pencils, eraser, ruler, calculator, admission card, ID.</p>

            <h4>❌ 10. Don’t Neglect Sleep</h4>
            <p>Many students stay up the whole night before the first exam. This kills focus, memory, and energy.</p>
            <p class="highlight">👉 Even if nervous, try to sleep at least 6–7 hours. Rest = sharper brain.</p>

            <p>✅ If students just avoid these traps, they’ll already be ahead of many others.</p>
